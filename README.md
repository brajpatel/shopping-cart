## About
This Shopping Cart project is the final React application in The Odin Project's [React JS section](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript#react-js) with the main objectives being to practice working with 'react-router-dom'. This was implemented by creating routes to different pages of the application. The app consists of three pages, a homepage, a shop that shows different products, and the cart that displays an empty cart message or all the items the user added to the carted, along with info such as quantity and price, and the total price of the cart. The user can increase or decrease the quantity of each product in the cart or remove a product entirely and the cart's price will adjust accordingly.

These are some of the challenges I faced while making this project:
- Finding a way to have the 'Nav' component visible on each page without re-rendering it
